    <h3>My story</h3>
    <p>I am a UI/UX Designer. My experience with an intensive online UI program called CareerFoundry has sharpened my eye for design.</p>
    <p>"During my career, I like to see myself as a UX/UI Designer at a company that is driven by the success of individual employees and the overall success of the community. I want to be valued and encourage personal development and strive to make positive contributions to society through my business. My overall mission is to continue to learn about personal and career development bettering myself even as I teach this information to others. I will also
want to improve my ability to seek out opportunities for others by assisting them in career opportunities. I want my career to be diverse with opportunities for challenge and growth. Each day brings another opportunity to develop people, build careers, and create opportunities."
